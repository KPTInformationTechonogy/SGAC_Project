              The Nigeria Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) profession is bound by existing policies, and all branches of CAM are legally regulated by the Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria (MDCN), Decree No. 38 of 1998, and the Medical and Dental Council Act of 1992. These regulations cover various forms of CAM specialties, such as Homeopathy, Naturopathy, Osteopathy, Chiropractic, and Acupuncture.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              However, the entire CAM profession as a cadre had been excluded from government promotion until the creation of the Traditional and Complementary Alternative Medicine (TCAM) Department at the Federal Ministry of Health in 2018. Since then, efforts to develop TCAM have been underway, following a step-by-step due process. Despite challenges, including the unapproved TCAM Council, the Federal Government and TCAM stakeholders have worked tirelessly to move the TCAM bill forward. We are hopeful that, with God&apos;s grace, the bill will be successful.

            <p className="mb-4">
              The term &quot;cure like cure&quot; typically refers to Classical Homeopathy. However, the concept of vital force is also a key factor in establishing the phenomenon of homeopathy as a whole. This term is often understood in relation to other traditional medicine systems, such as Qi in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), Prana in Ayurveda, and ODforce in Electro-Homeopathy.
            </p>
            <p>
              In ancient Spagyric medical science and philosophy, Mercury and Sulfur were considered among the basic elements. In Electro-Homeopathic approaches, Dr. Count Cesare Mattei&apos;s principles and his followers focus on healing through methodologies that involve condensing natural energy frequencies extracted from plants. These approaches involve studying patient temperaments clinically and applying remedies to the human body internally or externally, using multiple techniques that originated from plant electricity. The studies also explore the interlinkages between macrocosmic energy and microcosmic energy, transmitted as ODforce, according to the principles of Baron Karl (1788-1869), and the observation of pathological influences as excess or deficient energy.

            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              The ODForce (approximately translated as Prana in Vedic literature) is an example of CHI in Chinese culture, which was influenced by acupuncture. In Japan, this energy is called KI, while the Indians refer to it as Prana. Baron von Reichenbach called it OD, and Wilhelm Reich called it ORGON. In alchemy (Alchymie), it is referred to as CHY, and in homeopathy, it is known as VITAL FORCE.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">Relationship of Electro with ODForce</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              Here, I would like to provide details on Pranagni present in the body, which provides essential nutrients to life. Mattei refers to this Pranagni as electricity in his medicines, which plays an important role in bringing energy back to normal when it is lost. It is Pranagni that helps digest food through metabolic processes. The purification of the body is complete when the lungs become strong and healthy, and when electrical currents start flowing in the body due to friction with the air. The aspirant should practice controlling the ODFORCE outside or inside at will. Without prior purification of the entire body and nerves, control over Prana may cause trouble in the body.

            <p className="text-gray-700">
              The whole concept of Spagyric Electro-homeopathy is to observe the disintegration of Microcosm and Macrocosm from a holistic point of view and then consciously understand the equable correspondence of ODforce externally and internally. This is why invisible and visible therapeutic values must be considered as a way of transforming the internal body to balance through modulating resonance frequencies externally or internally. These may vary depending on the approach within Complementary and Alternative Medicine.

              Second: Homeopathy&apos;s Law is the oldest ancient principle of medical practice in history, later rediscovered by Hahnemann in his homeopathy, now known as Classical Homeopathy. The phenomenon of complex in complex is a totally different approach and is now used in Spagyric Therapy compared to original Classical Homeopathy.

            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Spagyric Therapy&apos;s roots can be linked to the beginning of mankind, thousands of years far back to the ancient rishis and Hippocrates. Spagyric became noticeable or popular over 500 years ago when Paracelsus elaborated on the logic or reinvented Spagyric in Europe, laying the foundation stone for today&apos;s modern chemistry. Unfortunately, his work was lost 500 years ago. He can be regarded as the grandfather of Pharmacy.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              In the 19th century, Count Mattei reinvented Spagyric Therapy, which had been lost since Paracelsus&apos; time. He created a new medical system using the Spagyric principle for manufacturing his medicine. Spagyric Therapy/Electro Homeopathic Medicine was coined by Count Cesare Mattei during his lifetime (1809-1896) in Bologna, Italy.

            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Spagyric&apos;s further development continued through Mattei&apos;s disciple, Karuss, who painstakingly revived and added more remedies to the system based on Mattei&apos;s Theory. Later, the Karuss Spagyric Method gained an official place in the German Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia. Unfortunately, the entire Spagyric system was lost again during World War II in Europe.

            <p className="mb-4">
              Electro-Homeopathy is formed from three words:
              Electro = energy,
              Homeo = similar, and
              Pathy = suffering.
            </p>
            <p>
              The phenomenon of electro in plants, blood, and lymph (morbid or both) involves studying the impurities of blood, lymph, and both, leading to constitutional pathology correspondence to the law of temperament and selection of remedies according to the law of opposites by registered Spagyric EH Practitioners. This is what we consider legitimate Spagyric EH practices in Nigeria.

            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              The law of Spagyric solution, essence, or remedies preparation, dilutions, research, and prescriptions is according to Mattie&apos;s Philosophy and the ancient intercontinental form of Spagyric medicine in collaboration with expert international Spagyric EH members partnering development in Nigeria.

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-green-700 mt-8 mb-2">What is Spagyric Therapy/EH Medicine Philosophy, Principles, and Practice?</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              The word &quot;Spagyric&quot; consists of two compounded words that mean &quot;separate&quot; and &quot;recombine.&quot; The final result is quantities and qualitative total volume and values of electricity found in plant extracts according to Spagyrism, known as ODforce in whole and in essence. The approaches of Spagyrism in remedy manufacturing are technically and spiritually considered in two dimensions: maceration process and cohobation.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              These procedures are concurrently engaged in transforming the healing substance in a physical, energetic, and spiritual manner of plants in planetary time. These are technically done to maximize the internal or external remedies&apos; therapeutic effect and responses by the whole body according to the philosophy of ancient Spagyrism and Electro-homeopathic healing techniques. All these should be recorded by the Nigeria Electro-homeopathic Society of Spagyric Medical Practitioners in clinical formats.

            <p className="mb-4">
              The efforts made by scholars in reserving the science of Spagyric Electro-homeopathy by Paracelsus, Count Cesare Mattei, Krauss, Zimple, Sauta, Fathemuller, and others, guided by Spagyrism as a whole, do not represent electronic devices, electromagnetic machines, energy medicine devices, or tools to manage, treat, or diagnose diseases.

            <p>
              Rather, it is a separate system of medicine that has been in practice and well understood as a unique procedure of pure plant innovative medicine within the scope of Complementary and Alternative Medicine in various countries such as Italy, Germany, France, United Kingdom, Sweden, Austria, Australia, USA, India, and Pakistan for the past 150 years in the history of Complementary and Alternative Medicine.

            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              In Germany, Spagyric Electro-homeopathic medicine was boldly written in the German Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia. In Europe, the practice of Spagyrism and Spagyric therapy had been used many years before the discovery of electricity in plant extracts under the philosophy of Count Cesare Mattei, and the practice was highly respected. It is the only recognized scientific system of plant-based medicine that goes along with the natural law of healing and equability in natural recovery. In some ancient books, it was documented as &quot;Magic medicine.&quot; Nigeria is now recognized among the sequence and series of countries that practice Spagyric Therapy/Electro-homeopathic Medicine and general services in Africa in the name of EH-CAM Spagyric.

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mt-8 mb-2">Spagyric Electro-Homeopathic Medicine is Not Substandard</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Spagyric Electro-homeopathic Medicine is not something lighter or substandard; moreover, it requires years of practice and mentorship following the study of Complementary and Alternative Medicine as a cadre, like Doctor of Homeopathy or Doctor of Naturopathy. The practice has an independent philosophy and clinical practice that takes us to pathology and diseases. Furthermore, incubation of diseases, diagnoses, prognoses, and factors supported by the philosophy empowered the pathological constitution seated due to vitiated fluids (lymph, blood, or mixed constitution) and corresponding temperament.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mt-8 mb-2">Spagyric Therapy/Electro-Homeopathic Philosophy</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              In Spagyric Therapy/Electro-homeopathic Philosophy, all mechanisms of Mercury, Salt, and Sulfur are virtually quantified as a whole. The influence of ODforce in the whole body and the effect of external temperament and internal body is fixed as quantum frequencies in the microcosm. The ODforce corresponds to Mercury and Sulfur, and the whole sequence of transformations between the macrocosm and microcosm is powered by the equable ODforce frequencies.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              The imbalance of ODforce acquired by the external temperament or inner body defect by the internal temperament ushers in clinical orientations that lead CAM practitioners in their basic assessment of transmutations forming constitutional pathology and symptoms corresponding to lymphatic temperament, Sanguine temperament, and Mixed temperament.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              In Spagyric Electro-homeopathic therapy, animals are valued, so the remedies are unique and well-known as plant-based scientific sources of medication. Poisonous plants are not allowed, and potent remedies are used in disease proportions equal to the reference temperament and totality of symptoms collected from the patient by a qualified CAM practitioner as methods of clinical diagnosis not merely as remedis prescription proceedures in pure homeopathy.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              All diseases are developed from the alteration of four basic phenomena according to the Spagyric Electro-homeopathic principle of practice:

            <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 mt-4 text-gray-700">
              <li className="mb-2">Impure blood, lymph, or both,</li>
              <li className="mb-2">Imbalance of ODforce,</li>
              <li className="mb-2">The disintegration of Mind, Soul, and Physical Body,</li>
              <li>Failure to control and oversee the specific temperament before prescription according to Spagyric remedies and EH-CAM temperament, governing the actual assortment among the three temperaments due to the over-influence of one against another.</li>
